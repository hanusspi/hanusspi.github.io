<p>Hello there and thanks for checking out my blog. Let me give you an introduction. My name is Hans Nusspickel. I am a german computer science student currently in between my bachelors and masters degree.</p>

<p>My goal with this blog is to sort, strucutre and track my personal projects and maybe even help somebody with my content. As this blog is still very young let me give you a short overview of the planned projects</p>

<p class="mb-5">The first big project will be a few posts about entropy coding, concerning ANS, its parallelization and execution on the gpu. These blogs will roughly follow my already written bachelor thesis. After this i want to practice a deep dive into data engineering and the gpu programming of neural networks.</p>
